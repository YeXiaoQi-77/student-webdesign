	<h1>Coffee: My Daily Comfort!</h1>
	<p>Coffee is a popular beverage made from the roasted beans of the Coffea plant. It is known for its rich aroma, bold flavor, and stimulating effects due to caffeine, a natural stimulant that helps increase alertness and energy levels. Coffee is prepared by brewing ground coffee beans with hot water, extracting their flavor and essential oils. It comes in various forms, including espresso, cappuccino, latte, and black coffee, each offering a unique taste and experience. Aside from being a daily ritual for many, coffee has cultural significance worldwide, often enjoyed in social settings, cafés, and as a personal morning ritual.</p>
